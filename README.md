Introducing a 2D pixel art world builder! The main concept revolves around importing a spritesheet filled with sprites, which you can then strategically place onto a grid. This allows you to paint and construct intricate worlds using a variety of different sprites, offering endless creative possibilities and opportunities for customization.
